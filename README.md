1. Gentle request I can't upload the file called 'venv' Folder because the folder contains the large number of files which is '2.24GB' which had cross the GitHub repository storage limit, which is above the '25MB', So please consider the remaining files.
2. But I had a 'video proof' recorded session of my whole complete project and I uploaded the video in 'LinkedIn' -> so this is my video proof of my complete project 'LinkedIn' link 'https://www.linkedin.com/posts/niranjan-m-d-76a479202_dataanalytics-timeseriesanalysis-stockmarketforecasting-activity-7343344807718674432-AaDq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADOuyAIBCA0cO3jDOyU5fF4PXSkTLFBoXpA'

## Project Overview

This project provides a robust framework for forecasting stock prices using three popular time series forecasting models: **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**, **Prophet (from Facebook)**, and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)**.

The primary goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of stock price prediction, including:
* Automated data collection for a specified ticker.
* Comprehensive data preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure time series consistency.
* Training and saving individual forecasting models.
* Evaluating model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* Visualizing actual vs. predicted prices for comparative analysis.

This modular approach allows for easy expansion, modification, and comparison of different forecasting techniques.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
* **Python 3.8+**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **pip**: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
'git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourStockPredictionRepo.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourStockPredictionRepo.git)'

'cd YourStockPredictionRepo' 

(Replace 'YourUsername/YourStockPredictionRepo' with your actual GitHub repository path)

Setting Up the Virtual Environment
--------------------------------
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

Bash

# Create a virtual environment
'python -m venv venv'

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
'.\venv\Scripts\activate'
# On macOS/Linux:
'source venv/bin/activate'

Installing Dependencies
------------------------
With your virtual environment activated, install all necessary packages:

Bash

'pip install -r requirements.txt'

If you don't have a 'requirements.txt' file yet, you'll need to create one. You can generate it by running 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' after manually installing the core libraries ('pandas', 'numpy', 'yfinance', 'statsmodels', 'prophet', 'tensorflow', 'scikit-learn', 'matplotlib', 'joblib').

 Alternatively, list them directly in 'requirements.txt':

'pandas'
'numpy'
'yfinance'
'statsmodels'
'prophet'
'tensorflow'
'scikit-learn'
'matplotlib'
'joblib'
'cmdstanpy' # Prophet dependency

The project is organized as follows:

├── scripts/

Usage
-----
To run the entire stock price prediction pipeline, simply execute the 'main.py' script from your project's root directory while your virtual environment is activated:


Bash

'.\venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/main.py'

(On Windows, use '.\venv\Scripts\python.exe'; on macOS/Linux, use 'venv/bin/python' or 'python' if 'source venv/bin/activate' was successful)

The script will perform the following steps sequentially:

1. Data Collection: Downloads historical data for AAPL.
2. Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data.
3. ARIMA/SARIMA Model Training: Trains and saves the ARIMA model.
4. Prophet Model Training: Trains and saves the Prophet model.
5. LSTM Model Training: Trains and saves the LSTM model.
6. Evaluation: Loads all models, makes predictions, calculates RMSE, and generates comparison plots.


Expected Outputs
-----------------
Upon successful execution, you will find generated files in the following directories:

  1. 'data/raw/': Contains 'AAPL_historical_data.csv'
  2. data/processed/: Contains AAPL_preprocessed_data.csv
  3. 'rained_models/': Contains 'arima_model.pkl', 'prophet_model.pkl', and 'lstm_model.h5'
  4. 'reports/': (Potentially, if 'evaluation.py' saves output files) A summary of RMSE values, and plots comparing actual vs. predicted values. Check your 'evaluation.py' and individual model scripts for plot saving logic (e.g., using 'plt.savefig()').


Models Implemented

This project utilizes three distinct time series forecasting models:

1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A classical statistical model for time series forecasting that considers autoregression, differencing, and moving averages. It's effective for capturing linear relationships in data.

2. Prophet: An open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook, designed for forecasting univariate time series with strong seasonal components and holidays. It's robust to missing data and shifts in the time series.

3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly well-suited for learning dependencies in sequential data, such as time series. LSTMs can capture complex non-linear patterns over long periods.

Results & Evaluation

The 'evaluation.py' script compares the performance of all trained models based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test dataset. Lower RMSE indicates a better fit to the actual values.

A summary of the RMSE for each model will be printed to the console upon completion, for example:

--- Model Evaluation Summary ---
ARIMA RMSE: [value]
Prophet RMSE: [value]
LSTM RMSE: [value]

Detailed plots showing the actual prices alongside the forecasts from each model will be generated. Look for these plots in the 'reports/' or 'dashboards/' directory, or displayed directly if 'plt.show()' is used without 'plt.savefig()'.

Customization
-------------
You can easily modify the project to analyze different stocks or time ranges:

1. Change Stock Ticker:
  1. Open 'scripts/data_collection.py'.
  2.  Modify the 'ticker' variable (e.g., 'GOOG', 'MSFT').
  3. If you change the ticker, remember to update the 'PROCESSED_DATA_PATH', 'ARIMA_MODEL_PATH', 'PROPHET_MODEL_PATH', and 'LSTM_MODEL_PATH' in all scripts ('data_collection.py', 'preprocessing.py', 'arima_sarima_model.py', 'prophet_model.py', 'lstm_model.py', 'evaluation.py') to reflect the new ticker name (e.g., 'GOOG_preprocessed_data.csv').

2. Adjust Date Range:
  1. Open scripts/data_collection.py.
  2. Modify start_date and end_date variables.

3. Model Hyperparameters:
  1. For ARIMA: Edit 'scripts/arima_sarima_model.py'to change the 'order' parameter.
  2. For Prophet: Edit 'scripts/prophet_model.py' to change parameters like 'daily_seasonality', 'weekly_seasonality', 'yearly_seasonality', or add custom regressors.
  3. For LSTM: Edit 'scripts/lstm_model.py' to adjust 'look_back', number of 'epochs', 'batch_size', or network architecture.

Troubleshooting

1. 'FileNotFoundError' for data/models: Ensure the directories ('data/raw', 'data/processed', 'trained_models', 'reports') exist. The 'main.py' script is designed to create these, but manual creation might be needed if something goes wrong.

2. 'FutureWarning' messages: These are typically warnings about upcoming changes in libraries like pandas. While they don't break the code, it's good practice to update your code to the recommended syntax (as addressed during development).

3. TensorFlow/Keras warnings about CPU instructions: These are informational messages and usually do not affect the execution or results.

4. 'cmdstanpy' INFO messages: Normal output from Prophet's underlying Stan optimizer.

5. "No common data points for RMSE calculation": This might occur if there's a significant mismatch or too many 'NaN' values after prediction alignment. Review your preprocessing and prediction steps.

6. 'yf.download() has changed argument auto_adjust default to True': This is a 'yfinance' warning, indicating a change in default behavior. It's generally harmless, but you can explicitly set 'auto_adjust=True' or 'auto_adjust=False' in 'yf.download()' to suppress it if desired.
